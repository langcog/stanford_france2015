\opening{Dear Stanford-France Center,}

We are writing jointly to express our enthusiasm for the shared project ``Learning sounds and meanings jointly in early language acquisition.'' We commit to participation in this project and to carrying out the work described in the project proposal. We are especially enthusiastic about the role of Abdellah Fourtassi as a visitor to Stanford, forming a bridge between LSCP and the Stanford Language and Cognition Lab and engaging in collaboration with students and postdocs at Stanford. 

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
