\opening{Dear Stanford-France Center}

I am writing to express my strong support for Abdellah Fourtassi as a visitor to my lab as part of the collaborative project ``Learning sounds and meanings jointly in early language acquisition.''

I first became aware of Abdellah's work as a result of hearing his supervisor, Emmanuel Dupoux (LSCP, Paris) talk about it at a presentation at MIT last fall. My own lab studies early language acquisition from the perspective of social communication and meaning, using a variety of computational tools that we borrow from machine learning and computer science. So when I heard Dr. Dupoux's talk, I immediately recognized exciting alignments between his lab's work, which applies the same computational techniques to issues in early speech sound learning, and my own. For this reason, when Abdellah reached out later in the fall to enquire about collaboration opportunities, I was extremely pleased and immediately invited him to visit my lab to explore this possibility further. 

Together 

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
