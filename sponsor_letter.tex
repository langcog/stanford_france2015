\opening{Dear Stanford-France Center}

I am writing to express my strong support for Abdellah Fourtassi as a visitor to my lab as part of the collaborative project ``Learning sounds and meanings jointly in early language acquisition.''

I first became aware of Abdellah's work as a result of hearing his supervisor, Emmanuel Dupoux (LSCP, Paris) talk about it at a presentation at MIT last fall. My own lab studies early language acquisition from the perspective of social communication and meaning, using a variety of computational tools that we borrow from machine learning and computer science. So when I heard Dr. Dupoux's talk, I immediately recognized exciting alignments between his lab's work, which applies the same computational techniques to issues in early speech sound learning, and my own. For this reason, when Abdellah reached out later in the fall to enquire about collaboration opportunities, I was extremely pleased and immediately invited him to visit my lab to explore this possibility further. 

We have worked together on the proposed research statement that we are submitting; I believe that this work will serve to cement the nascent collaboration between our two labs. If funded, Abdellah will travel to visit my lab for the summer and perhaps part of the fall, working directly with myself and other members of the lab. Specifically, he will meet with me on at least a weekly basis, and will collaborate directly with Daniel Yurovsky and Gabriel Doyle, two postdoctoral fellows in my lab who have related interests. In addition, as a visitor to the developmental part of the psychology department, he will attend my group's lab meetings as well as the weekly Developmental Brownbag seminars, Psychology Department colloquia, and occasional Psycholinguistics Interest Group meetings. In sum, Abdellah will be integrated into our departmental and lab culture. 

I am very enthusiastic about this collaboration and believe that Abdellah's visits (and the broader set of links with Dr. Dupoux's lab) will allow my group to collaborate on investigating new topics of interest that we do not have the expertise to explore on our own. Thus, this proposal will substantially increase our research capacity. 

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
